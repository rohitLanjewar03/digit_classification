DIGIT CLASSIFICATION USING NUMPY

PROJECT OVERVIEW :-
This project implements a simple Neural Network to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using NumPy only.  
No machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn were used.

FEATURES :-
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- ReLU & Softmax activation
- Cross-entropy loss
- Accuracy calculation
- Visualization using Matplotlib

TECH STACK :-
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

DATASET :- 
- MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- Loaded manually using `.npz` file

RESULTS:- 
- Training Accuracy: ~90%
- Test Accuracy: ~89–91%
